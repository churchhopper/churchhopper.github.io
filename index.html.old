    <p><q>Church hoppers</q> get a bad rap in Christian circles. They're treated like groupies that follow whatever band they are into at the time then move on to the next cool show that pops up. It's fair to say that some folks have a hard time with commitment, but it isn't necessarily their fault. Most of them just aren't getting whatever it is they're looking for but keep trying new churches out.</p>

        Who in their right mind would go through the energy of visiting a church, investing their time and emotion into that church, and contributing to that church then just drop it all to go on to something more exciting? What if the problem is the unmet expectations they had for each of these churches? Even worse, what if they've visited so many churches and been let down so many times they give up? Sounds like dating, right? The single adult who decides to settle for whatever okay prospect comes along or gives up on dating altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's roll with the analogy. Is the problem the expectations or the churches? Every church can't be that bad. A person shouldn't feel forced to feel at home on Sunday morning. They shouldn't need to convince the whole family
